    "## Document-level context\n",
    "[SpanMarker](https://github.com/tomaarsen/SpanMarkerNER) is an accessible yet powerful Python module for training Named Entity Recognition models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I'll show you how to perform training and inference of SpanMarker models using document-level context to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many approaches to NER process individual sentences completely independently of another, even if the sentences originate from the same document. Although this works fine, research has shown that including additional contextual information (i.e. the previous and next sentence(s)) improves the performance of the model. In my own experiments of SpanMarker with CoNLL03, including this document-level contextual information improves the model from a mean F1 of 92.9±0.0 to a mean F1 of 94.1±0.1."

    "### Document-level context in SpanMarker\n",
    "SpanMarker is designed to require only slight changes in the input data to allow for document-level context during training, evaluating and inference. In particular, the only required change is that the input must now be a [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset) with `document_id` and `sentence_id` columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training and evaluating\n",
    "For training and evaluation, the dataset must now contain `tokens`, `ner_tags`, `document_id` and `sentence_id` columns. I've prepared two datasets ([tomaarsen/conll2003](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomaarsen/conll2003), [tomaarsen/conllpp](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomaarsen/conllpp)) that I've used to train some models. We will have a look at the former to get a feel for how these values are used."
